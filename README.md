## p5-js simulations

This repository contains practice codes I wrote while learning javascript and p5-js to create web animations for [ThePhysicsHub](https://github.com/openpsimu) project.

### Usage

To run the simulations, simply clone the repo, add the simulation script in the [index.html](index.html) file and open in a browser.
